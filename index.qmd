***INSERT CAPTION***

Aquaculture currently produces over half of all fish consumed by humans. With an average annual growth rate of 6% since 2001 it is one of the fastest growing food production sectors globally1. Approximately 70% of animal aquaculture production is fed aquaculture, where high-protein aquafeeds are formulated from a large variety of raw materials2. Historically the sector was heavily reliant on fishmeal and oil but concerns about pressures on wildforage-fish stocks and increasing cost of these products led to a major shift towards terrestrial and novel ingredients3.Now the industry is developing a wide range of feeds with fishmeal and oil judiciously combined with alternative sources of protein and lipids derived from diverse raw materials including plant proteins and oils, micro-algae and insects4. This shift is a major achievement but its potential effects are not well understood5. There are many clear benefits but there will also be some negative effects (both known and unknown). They are likely to be diverse, including impacts on terrestrial and aquatic farming systems and ecosystems, human livelihoods, health, nutrition, that are globally connected through trade and international corporations. These major unknowns urgently need to be addressed to allow the aquaculture industry to expand efficiently and to sustainably enhance its contribution to the Australian (and global) economy.

Aquaculture growth is pivotal in supporting a suite of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as Zero Hunger, Good Health and Wellbeing, Sustainable Production and Consumption, but needs to do so without compromising Life in the Water and Life on Land. Compared to land-based animal protein food production systems, aquaculture is generally more environmentally efficient (in terms of feed conversion, land/sea-use and greenhouse gases) 6. However, even the most comprehensive comparisons of food systems do not include the full suite of environmental and social impacts nor do they include the critical linkages with other food sectors; crucially, with those on land7--9. Without comprehensive knowledge of the links and environmental impacts of novel feed sources we are currently unprepared to predict the consequences of the anticipated and necessary growth of aquaculture, potentially hindering our capacity to achieve SDGs.
