## **New tools to support environmentally sustainable aquaculture feeds**

Our project aims to develop a new interdisciplinary sustainability assessment framework to improve our understanding of the consequences of changing raw materials used in aquaculture feeds.

## **Why are aquafeeds important?**
:::{layout-ncol="2"}

Aquaculture currently produces over half of all fish consumed by humans and is an important sector for future food security. Over 70% of animal aquaculture is dependent on human-made 'aquafeeds' which  typically embed the majority of the environmental impacts in the life-cycle of farmed fish. Aquafeeds therefore present a key lever for improving the sustainability of the aquaculture sector.

Aquafeeds are manufactured using a spectrum of ingredients and raw materials, sourced from both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Feed composition has changed dramatically in recent years and continues to with availability of resources, but comprehensive understanding of the environmental implications of feed changes is lacking. We are working towards a more holistic and spatially explicit understanding of environmental pressures (greenhouse gas emissions, water extraction, nutrient pollution, habitat disturbance) from feed production and how these translate to impacts (e.g. biodiversity, ecosystem function) at global and local scales.
