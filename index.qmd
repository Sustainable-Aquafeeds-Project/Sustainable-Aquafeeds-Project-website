# New tools to support environmentally sustainable aquafeeds

Our project aims to develop a new interdisciplinary sustainability assessment framework to improve our understanding of the consequences of changing aquafeeds in aquaculture.

## Why are aquafeeds important?

-   Aquaculture currently produces over half of all fish consumed by humans and is an important sector for future food security.

-   Fed aquaculture currently relies on a large variety of feed ingredients (such as crops, fishmeal and oil, insects, microalgae sourced around the world) and the balance of these is rapidly changing.

-   While some innovations have led to more environmentally efficient aquaculture overall, the choice of feed ingredients can still massively affect the environmental pressures associated with aquaculture.

-   We are working towards more holistic uncerstanding of multiple pressures (such as water extraction, GHG emissions, nutrient pollution, habitat disturbance) translate into impacts (biodiversity, ecosystem function) - at both global and local scales.
