Aquaculture currently produces over half of all fish consumed by humans and is an important sector for future food security. Fed aquaculture currently relies on a large variety of feed ingredients (such as crops, fishmeal and oil, insects, microalgae sourced around the world) and the balance of these is rapidly changing.

While innovations have led to more environmentally efficient aquaculture overall, the choice of feed ingredients can still massively affect both the environmental impacts associated with aquaculture.

Our project aims to develop a new interdisciplinary sustainability assessment framework to improve our understanding of the consequences of changing feeds in aquaculture by developing integrative models and experiments at both local and global scales.
