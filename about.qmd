# Our approach

Our project is advancing three research areas to create a new sustainable aquaculture feed toolbox:

### 1) Spatial mapping of global environmental pressures and impacts

The "where" and "how" of what raw materials are used for feed can matter more or just as much as the type of ingredient itself. By spatially mapping the cumulative pressures associated with alternative feed scenarios - globally - we can provide detailed information on how combinations of feed ingredients used by our partners could minimise these pressures. By understanding and translating these pressures into impacts, such as reducing biodiversity loss or ocean acidification, we will better inform decision making to ensure sustainable development of aquaculture.

### 2) Predictive modelling of local ecosystem impacts

Even at a local scale, there is limited information on how changes in feed ingredients could affect ecosystem structure and biodiversity, to minimise impacts while maintaining aquaculture production. We are developing and testing a range of ecological models as predictive tools, using detailed data from aquaculture digestibility and growth experiments.

### 3) Future scenario projections to assess trade-offs across sustainable development goals

Aquaculture's growth in future relies on the supply of different marine and terrestrial feed resources and suitable environment to grow target species. Like other food sectors, supply faces numerous risks such as climate and global change. We are examining short-term shocks and long-term risks facing aquaculture, and how these might be minimised through alternatives feed ingredients and development.
