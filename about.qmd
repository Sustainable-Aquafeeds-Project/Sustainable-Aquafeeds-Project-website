# Our approach

Our project is advancing three research areas to create a new sustainable aquaculture feed toolbox:

### 1) Mapping the environmental footprint of aquafeeds

Raw materials used in aquafeeds are sourced from fisheries and agriculture systems globally. Geographical differences in how raw materials are produced and processed can drive substantial changes to the environmental footprint of aquafeeds. By mapping the cumulative pressures associated with alternative feed scenarios -  we can provide detailed information on how combinations of feed ingredients used by our partners could optimise the carbon, water, nutrient, and biodiversity footprints of aquafeeds for multiple farmed species.

### 2) Predictive modelling of local ecosystem impacts

Aquafeeds are harvested globally but used locally. There is limited information on how changes in feed ingredients could affect ecosystem structure and biodiversity at the farm scale. We are developing and testing a range of ecological models as predictive tools, using detailed data from aquaculture digestibility and growth experiments.

### 3) Future scenario projections to assess trade-offs across sustainable development goals

Aquaculture's growth in future relies on the supply of different marine and terrestrial feed resources and suitable environment to grow target species. Like other food sectors, supply faces numerous risks such as climate and global change. We are examining short-term shocks and long-term risks facing aquaculture, and how these might be minimised through alternatives feed ingredients and development
