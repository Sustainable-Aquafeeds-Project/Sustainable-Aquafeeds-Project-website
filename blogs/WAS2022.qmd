At the end of our first full year of the Sustainable Aquafeeds Project, PhD Candidate Sowdamini Sesha Prasad and Research Fellow Rich Cottrell travelled to Singapore in December 2022 to present their research on local to global aquafeeds sustainability assessment at the World Aquaculture Society conference. Great science, networking, and fun had by all (with the exception of bizarre student mixer!) - and Sowdamini's first international conference presentation. Well done, Sowdamini!
