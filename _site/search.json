    "text": "Aquaculture currently produces over half of all fish consumed by humans. With an average annual growth rate of 6% since 2001 it is one of the fastest growing food production sectors globally1. Approximately 70% of animal aquaculture production is fed aquaculture, where high-protein aquafeeds are formulated from a large variety of raw materials2. Historically the sector was heavily reliant on fishmeal and oil but concerns about pressures on wildforage-fish stocks and increasing cost of these products led to a major shift towards terrestrial and novel ingredients3.Now the industry is developing a wide range of feeds with fishmeal and oil judiciously combined with alternative sources of protein and lipids derived from diverse raw materials including plant proteins and oils, micro-algae and insects4. This shift is a major achievement but its potential effects are not well understood5. There are many clear benefits but there will also be some negative effects (both known and unknown). They are likely to be diverse, including impacts on terrestrial and aquatic farming systems and ecosystems, human livelihoods, health, nutrition, that are globally connected through trade and international corporations. These major unknowns urgently need to be addressed to allow the aquaculture industry to expand efficiently and to sustainably enhance its contribution to the Australian (and global) economy.\nAquaculture growth is pivotal in supporting a suite of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as Zero Hunger, Good Health and Wellbeing, Sustainable Production and Consumption, but needs to do so without compromising Life in the Water and Life on Land. Compared to land-based animal protein food production systems, aquaculture is generally more environmentally efficient (in terms of feed conversion, land/sea-use and greenhouse gases) 6. However, even the most comprehensive comparisons of food systems do not include the full suite of environmental and social impacts nor do they include the critical linkages with other food sectors; crucially, with those on land7–9. Without comprehensive knowledge of the links and environmental impacts of novel feed sources we are currently unprepared to predict the consequences of the anticipated and necessary growth of aquaculture, potentially hindering our capacity to achieve SDGs."

As a part of her ARC future fellowship and ARC linkage project, she will be studying the linkages between fisheries, agriculture and aquaculture. She is leading this project and supervising two PhD students\n\n\nProf Chris Carter\nChris Carter has been researching fish feeds and ingredients since his PhD (1990) in which he used energy budgets to investigate 3 different feeds for grass carp. Since then, he and colleagues have worked on: new formulated feeds for species such as rock lobsters, salmonids and tuna; nutritionally viable alternatives to fishmeal and fish oil including plants and microorganisms; using additives such as enzymes to improve feeds and ingredients. An important focus is to advance our understanding of the nutritional physiology of fish and shellfish to explore mechanisms that underpin efficiency of growth and using feeds\n\n\nDr Louise Adams\n\n*Insert bio*\n\n\nProf Catriona MacLeod\n\nProfessor Catriona Macleod is interim Executive Director at the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies at the University of Tasmania. She has more than 25 years’ experience in marine and coastal impact assessment, ecosystem interactions and natural resource management, particularly in relation to aquaculture. She has a keen interest in understanding system-wide interactions and multiple use management issues. Government and industry collaborations have focused on improving spatial planning processes and science informed decision making that links environmental management practices and community values. Her team’s research has informed both regulatory policy and strategic planning for aquaculture activities locally and internationally.\n\n\nDr Beth Penrose\nDr Beth Penrose is an interdisciplinary scientist working on the link between soil and plant nutrition and human and animal health. She is interested in how nutrients flow through systems and is focussed on minerals, including micronutrients and contaminants.\n\n\nDr Camille White\n\n\n\nDr Scott Hadley\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartner investigators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Duncan Cameron\nDuncan Cameron is an award-winning professor of plant and soil biology and Co-Director of the ‘flagship’ research institute, The Institute for Sustainable Food at the University of Sheffield, UK. He is an environmental microbiologist/biological chemist and his research seeks to understand how soil microbes enhance plant nutrition and health in the context of sustainable agriculture and global food security. He has held prestigious UK and international fellowships including a Royal Society University Research Fellowship along with international fellowships in Germany and Australia.\n\n\nProfessor Ben Halpern\n\nDr. Ben Halpern is the Director of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) and Professor in the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara. His research leverages environmental data science and synthesis to address a wide range of topics centered on the many ways that human activities are impacting ocean ecosystems and species, and the consequences of those impacts on the benefits we receive in return. For the linkage grant, Ben will co-lead work to globally map cumulative pressures from different aquaculture feed compositions\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry partners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Whyte\n\n\n\n\nErik Gracey\n\n\n\nDr Helen Hamilton\n\n\n\nDr Tom Fox-Smith\n\n\n\nMarceau (?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhD students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexandra Johne\n\n\n\nXin Zhan (Kathy)\n\n\n\nSowdamini Sesha Prasad"
