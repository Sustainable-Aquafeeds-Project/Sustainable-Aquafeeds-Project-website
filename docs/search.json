    "text": "Aquaculture currently produces over half of all fish consumed by humans and is an important sector for future food security. Over 70% of animal aquaculture is dependent on human-made ‘aquafeeds’ which can account for the majority of environmental impacts in the life-cycle of farmed fish. Aquafeeds thus present a key lever for improving the sustainability of the aquaculture sector."
