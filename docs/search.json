    "text": "Our approach\nOur project is advancing three research areas to create a new sustainable aquaculture feed toolbox:\n\n1) Spatial mapping of global environmental pressures and impacts\nThe “where” and “how” of what raw materials are used for feed can matter more or just as much as the type of ingredient itself. By spatially mapping the cumulative pressures associated with alternative feed scenarios - globally - we can provide detailed information on how combinations of feed ingredients used by our partners could minimise these pressures. By understanding and translating these pressures into impacts, such as reducing biodiversity loss or ocean acidification, we will better inform decision making to ensure sustainable development of aquaculture.\n\n\n2) Predictive modelling of local ecosystem impacts\nEven at a local scale, there is limited information on how changes in feed ingredients could affect ecosystem structure and biodiversity, to minimise impacts while maintaining aquaculture production. We are developing and testing a range of ecological models as predictive tools, using detailed data from aquaculture digestibility and growth experiments.\n\n\n3) Future scenario projections to assess trade-offs across sustainable development goals\nAquaculture’s growth in future relies on the supply of different marine and terrestrial feed resources and suitable environment to grow target species. Like other food sectors, supply faces numerous risks such as climate and global change. We are examining short-term shocks and long-term risks facing aquaculture, and how these might be minimised through alternatives feed ingredients and development"

Rich’s expertise centres broadly on food system sustainability, specifically on the importance of aquatic-terrestrial linkages for sustainability outcomes.\n\n\nProf Chris Carter\nChris Carter has been researching fish feeds and ingredients since his PhD (1990) in which he used energy budgets to investigate 3 different feeds for grass carp. Since then, he and colleagues have worked on: new formulated feeds for species such as rock lobsters, salmonids and tuna; nutritionally viable alternatives to fishmeal and fish oil including plants and microorganisms; using additives such as enzymes to improve feeds and ingredients.\n\n\nDr Louise Adams\n\n*Insert bio*\n\n\nProf Catriona MacLeod\n\nProfessor Catriona Macleod is interim Executive Director at the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies at the University of Tasmania. She has more than 25 years’ experience in marine and coastal impact assessment, ecosystem interactions and natural resource management, particularly in relation to aquaculture. She has a keen interest in understanding system-wide interactions and multiple use management issues.\n\n\nDr Beth Penrose\n\nDr Beth Penrose is an interdisciplinary scientist working on the link between soil and plant nutrition and human and animal health. She is interested in how nutrients flow through systems and is focussed on minerals, including micronutrients and contaminants.\n\n\n\n\n\nPartner investigators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Duncan Cameron\n\nDuncan Cameron is an award-winning professor of plant and soil biology and former Co-Director of the ‘flagship’ research institute, The Institute for Sustainable Food at the University of Sheffield, UK.

His research leverages environmental data science and synthesis to address a wide range of topics centered on the many ways that human activities are impacting ocean ecosystems and species, and the consequences of those impacts on the benefits we receive in return. For the linkage grant, Ben will co-lead work to globally map cumulative pressures from different aquaculture feed compositions\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry partners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Whyte\n\n\n\n\nErik Gracey\n\nI am BioMar’s Group Sustainability Manager – Commercial. I have a BA in International Business, an Associate of Science in Atmospheric Science, and an MSC in Industrial Ecology. My professional highlights include working with salmon farmers in Western Norway on Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture, upcycling of seafood by-products into new products for human consumption, and now at BioMar - building resilient supply chains for sustainable farmed seafood – from farm to fork.\n\n\nDr Helen Hamilton\n\n\n\nDr Tom Fox-Smith\n\n\n\nMarceau Cormery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhD students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexandra Johne\n\nAlex moved to Hobart about 6 and a half years ago to study Marine Biology at IMAS. For her BSc Honours project, she used an integral projection model (IPM) to explore individual growth variability in farmed Chinook salmon in response to different feed ration levels. Prior to starting her PhD, she worked as a research assistant for the Blue Economy Cooperative Research Centre, collating information on the challenges of rearing salmonids in offshore aquaculture. In her PhD, Alex explores inter- and intra-individual variability in feed efficiency, growth trajectories and nutrient outputs of farmed salmon under different climate change and feed composition scenarios.\n\n\nXin Zhan (Kathy)\n\nKathy completed a Master of Marine and Antarctic Science at UTAS in 2021. Currently, she is a PhD candidate studying the mineral composition of Atlantic salmon. My main research interests focus on aquatic finfish morphology, digestibility, histology, microbiome, transcriptome as well as tracking nutrient distribution from the environment, feed ingredients to products, especially minerals.\n\n\nSowdamini Sesha Prasad\n\nSowdamini worked on human-wildlife conflict and terrestrial ecology in southern India before moving to Australia. Currently, she is a PhD candidate at UTAS and will be modelling the impacts of feed stoichiometric changes through fish and food webs. Her project is co-funded by the linkage grant and will integrate experiments and models to assess local impacts of changing feeds."

    "text": "Why are aquafeeds important?\n\n\n\nAquaculture currently produces over half of all fish consumed by humans and is an important sector for future food security. Over 70% of animal aquaculture is dependent on human-made ‘aquafeeds’ which typically embed the majority of the environmental impacts in the life-cycle of farmed fish. Aquafeeds therefore present a key lever for improving the sustainability of the aquaculture sector."

Feed composition has changed dramatically in recent years and continues as resource availabilty changes. Yet, comprehensive understanding of the environmental implications of feed changes is lacking.\nWe are working towards a more holistic understanding of environmental pressures (greenhouse gas emissions, water extraction, nutrient pollution, habitat disturbance) from feed production and how these translate to impacts (e.g. biodiversity, ecosystem function) at local and global scales."
