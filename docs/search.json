    "text": "Our project is advancing three research areas to create a new sustainable aquaculture feed toolbox\n\n\n1) Mapping the environmental footprint of aquafeeds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw materials used in aquafeeds are sourced from fisheries and agriculture systems globally. Geographical differences in how raw materials are produced and processed can drive substantial changes to the environmental footprint of aquafeeds.\nBy mapping the cumulative pressures associated with different feed scenarios - we can provide detailed information on how various ingredient combinations used by our partners could optimise the carbon, water, nutrient, and biodiversity footprints of aquafeeds.\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Predictive modelling of local ecosystem impacts\n\n\n\nAquafeeds are harvested globally but used locally. While the raw materials and ingredients in aquafeeds have changed dramatically in recent years, there is limited information on how changes to feed composition affects ecosystem processes, structure, and biodiversity at local scales.\nWe are developing and testing a range of ecological models as predictive tools, using detailed data from aquaculture digestibility and growth experiments to provide new approaches to aquafeed sustainablility assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3) Future scenario projections to assess trade-offs across sustainable development goals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAquaculture’s growth in future relies on the supply of different marine and terrestrial feed resources and a suitable environment to grow target species. Like other food sectors, supply faces numerous risks such as climate and global change.\nWe are examining how short-term shocks and long-term climate risks alter the resilience and sustainability of aquafeed supply, and how supply risks be minimised through different feed formulation scenarios."

    "text": "Why are aquafeeds important?\nAquaculture currently produces over half of all fish consumed by humans and is an important sector for future food security. Over 70% of animal aquaculture is dependent on human-made ‘aquafeeds’ which can account for the majority of environmental impacts in the life-cycle of farmed fish. Aquafeeds thus present a key lever for improving the sustainability of the aquaculture sector."

    "text": "What are aquafeeds made from?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAquafeeds are manufactured using a large range of ingredients and raw materials, from crop, fish and livestock products and byproducts, to insects and single-celled organisms. Feed composition has changed dramatically in recent years and continues to evolve as resource availabilty changes. Yet, comprehensive understanding of the environmental implications of feed composition changes is lacking.\nWe are working towards a more holistic understanding of environmental pressures (greenhouse gas emissions, water extraction, nutrient pollution, habitat disturbance) from feed production and how these translate to impacts (e.g. biodiversity, ecosystem function) at local and global scales."
